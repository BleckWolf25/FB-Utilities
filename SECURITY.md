# Security Policy

Maintaining the security of this project is of utmost importance. We appreciate your efforts to help us safeguard our repository and our users. This document describes the process for reporting potential security vulnerabilities in this codebase.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in our project, **do not open a public issue**. Instead, please follow these steps:

1. **Gather Details:**  
   Collect all relevant information, including steps to reproduce the vulnerability, the impact of the issue, and any supporting artifacts or logs that can help us understand the problem.

2. **Contact Us Securely:**  
   Send your report to our dedicated security team at:  
   **Email:** [coutinho4gaming@gmail.com]  

3. **Provide Adequate Disclosure:**  
   Please ensure your report includes:  
   - A detailed explanation of the vulnerability.
   - The environment in which you discovered the issue (e.g., development branch, production, OS, browser version).
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Any potential fixes or suggestions, if applicable.

4. **Respect Responsible Disclosure:**  
   We request that you allow us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and resolve the issue before any public discussion or disclosure. Public disclosure of the vulnerability before a fix is deployed could put our users at risk.

## What to Expect After You Report

- **Acknowledgment:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within a reasonable timeframe.
- **Investigation:** Our team will review the information provided and reach out for any additional details that may be required.
- **Resolution and Update:** Once the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work diligently to patch the issue. We may provide a public advisory when the fix is available.
- **Confidentiality:** Your identity and details of your report will be handled with care. Any sensitive information in your report will remain confidential unless you explicitly agree to public disclosure.

## Supported Versions

This policy applies to all public releases of the project. If you are using a fork or an unofficial release, please refer to that versionâ€™s security policy, if available.

## Additional Reporting Guidelines

- **No Public Disclosure:** Refrain from sharing vulnerability specifics publicly until we have a confirmed patch or acknowledgment.
- **Clear Reproduction Steps:** Providing clear and concise reproduction steps will help us address the issue faster.
- **Follow-Up:** If we contact you for further information, please provide updates as promptly as possible.

## Thank You

Your efforts to report security issues help improve the quality and safety of this project for everyone. We value your contribution to making our open-source community more secure.
